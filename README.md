# BrachyuraVST3
So this is my first proper piece of software. I wrote it in C++ using the JUCE framework. <br> <br> This is an audio effect of distortion compiled as a VST3 plug in so you can put it and use it in your Digital Audio Workstation (i tested it in Ableton Live and FL Studio 12). <br> <br> It is basically something i did for fun and for learning more about audio processing and software development.   Hope you like it. <br> <br> PS. You can build it yourself using the source code or you can drag the Brachyura.vst3 file and paste it in your plug in folder and do whatever you need to do using your DAW to import it. In FL Studio, for instance you just have to add the folder and scan it so you can later use it on your mixer.
